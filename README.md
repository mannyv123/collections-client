# Collections

Collections is a platform for professional and amateur photographers to showcase their work through albums (called "Collections"). This is a redesign of my original capstone project from BrainStation. This project also adds TypeScript for the front and back end.

The site uses Mapbox GL JS to render a globe with markers showing images posted by users of the platform. This allows others to explore collections based on where the photos were taken.

Clicking on a marker brings up the related photo as a popup, as well as the full collection along the bottom.
